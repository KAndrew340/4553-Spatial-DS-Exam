## Spatial Data Structures Final Exam
Fall 2015

### Overview

Take the binary tree implementation provided in this repo and convert it into a 2D-Tree. Use the same
method of insertion that a KD-Tree would use by assigning a discriminator at each level, but don't worry
about any data beyond two dimensions. The binary tree implementation was found on some random stack overflow
post, but it's a pretty thorough implementation. I didn't write it, so I didn't comment the code.

- Provided in the repository is a copy of the original paper for you to reference.
- Also, you may use the internet to assist with your python questions but you may ONLY visit: https://docs.python.org !! If I see you on another site, you will be given a zero.

### Instructions

- Clone this repository to the computer your working on in the lab.
- Copy the `binary_tree.py` into a file called `2D-Tree.py`.
- Make all necessary changes to the file to make sure it conforms to the rules of a Kd-Tree implementation.
- Besides the 100 random values, also insert the values ([11,11],[22,22],[33,33],[44,44],[55,55],[66,66],[77,77],[88,88],[99,99],[100,100]) after the random values are inserted.
- Print all the TreeNodes incurred when searching for [100,100] to a file, and remember to include the "level" of the node in your print out.
- Add your new code to the repository.
- Add your output file to the repository.
- Answer the questions below.


### Lastly Fill Out the Questionnaire below:

You must complete the questionnaire, or I won't grade your exam.

Remember this was my first attempt at teaching this class, so your not gonna hurt my feelings. Not that you
worry about that anyway! Give feedback please.

 1. Was python a good language for this course? Would you like to use another, or a mix?

 ```
 Answer: Yes, I think the syntax is shorter and the modules were easy to install (on the lab computers) using pip.
         I think a mix of languages would be good to learn in this course, but an introduction to the languages
         should be taught first before projects.


 ```



 2. Should I have concentrated more on the "data structures" and less on writing programs to use the structures? Meaning should I have made an attempt to add to the 4 main structures we covered.

  ```
 Answer: I think both is important. Learning the data structure and not knowing how to use it is useless, and vice versa


 ```



 3. Were there enough? Or not enough programs for the semester?


  ```
 Answer: There were enough. My main problem was getting the python modules installed on my computer.


 ```



 4. I already know I should grade programs faster so you don't need to comment on that. I also know my knowledge of the subject matter could be better. I plan on working on both.

  ```
 Answer: No, I actually think that giving us time to complete the projects was fair and your knowledge of the subject
         was tremendous.


 ```



 5. Did you turn in all your programs? If not why, and how many did you get working?


  ```
 Answer: I turned in all the projects. I got at least the base code of all working. The last project I had difficulty
         finishing because pantograph slowed my system down greatly


 ```



 6. What is your assumed grade in this course? Meaning based on what you completed, what do you think you earned.


  ```
 Answer: I honestly don't know. But I am hoping that I did enough to get a good grade


 ```



 7. Is this the same, or different than what you thought your grade would be at the start of the semester?

 ```
 Answer: Not sure what the class would have turned out to be, but I did learn a lot more than spatial data


 ```
